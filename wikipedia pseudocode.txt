Input: A graph G.
Output: A proper coloring c of the edges of G
Let U := E(G)
while U ≠ ∅ do
1. Let (u,v) be any edge in U. 
2. Let F[1:k] be a maximal fan of u starting at F[1]=v. 
3. Let c be a color that is free on u and d be a color that is free on F[k]. 
4. Invert the cdu path 
5. Let w ∈ V(G) be such that w ∈ F, F'=[F[1]...w] is a fan and d is free on w. 
6. Rotate F' and set c(u,w)=d. 
7. U := U - {(u,v)} 
end while
